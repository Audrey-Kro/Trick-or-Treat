# Trick-or-Treat

Halloween themed Slide and Catch

Instructions:
Using the left and right arrow keys collect as many candies as you can while avoiding the broccoli.

-----------

Project Goals:
Change traditionally drawn sprites to digital
Add animation to menu screen and playerSprite
	(Have playerSprite react to sprite it collides with)
	(Have playerSprite switch direction faced when hitting left and right arrow keys)
Add music
Add sound effect after the timer runs out

I learned a lot through working on this project. What took the longest to learn and implement was the playerSprite changing "emotion" depending on what other sprite it collides with. For example, when the playerSprite collides with the chocolate or gumballs it switches from neutral to happy. Or, when the playerSprite comes into contact with a broccoli it gets grossed out.

I got stuck on the sound effects. More specifically when I was trying to have background music with an additional sound effect over top of it. I wound up looking up a lot of different videos and eventually brute forced it to work.

I'd like to improve my overall understanding of animation in coding.

I'd approach things differently next time by creating a tier list of goals, that way I won't be constantly switching between everything the game needs and making it look pretty.
Compared to the game design document I'd say this stayed relatively similar. There were, however, many additional things added onto this game that wasn't in the game design document. The game over screen was something I completely forgot about in my game design. I knew I wanted the overall game to be time based and to show the total score the player received at the end but I had no clue how I was going to design the actual screen. Overall, I'm happy with how it turned out.

It took me a minute to officially get into things but once I figure out what my priorities were I was able to take care of the big things such as sound design and character animation, then move onto the smaller (important) things such as aesthetic design.
